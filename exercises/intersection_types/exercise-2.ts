  comments: 'This short novel, already a modern classic, is the superbly told, tragic story of a Cuban fisherman in the Gulf Stream and the giant Marlin he kills and loses â€” specifically referred to in the citation accompanying the author\'s Nobel Prize for literature in 1954.'

  comments: 'To go by this debut, which was written well before she turned 18 last week, Laura Marling\'s "adolescence" was essentially a protracted period of soaking up Joni Mitchell and Bonnie "Prince" Billy. The unnervingly grown-up Alas I Cannot Swim is the result, and if it doesn\'t install her as the heir to the likes of Devendra Banhart, there\'s no hope for folk-pop.'
